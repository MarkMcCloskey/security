Forensics Warmup 1
------------------
Can you unzip this file for me and retreive the flag?
unzip flag.zip ->flag.jpg
flag in jpg.

Forensics Warmup 2
------------------
Hmm for some reason I can't open this png? Any ideas?
...literally double click the file
picoCTF{extensions_are_a_lie}

file flag.png -> it's a JPEG.

General Warmup 1
----------------
If I told you your grade was 0x41 in hexadecimal, what
would it be in ASCII?

See ASCII table -> A
picoCTF{A}

General Warmup 2
----------------
Can you convert the number 27(base 10) to binary(base 2)?

27/2 -> 13 remainder 1
13/2 -> 6 remainder 1
6/2 -> 3 remainder 0
3/2 -> 1 remainder 1
1/2 -> 0 remainder 1

picoCTF{11011}

General Warmup 3
----------------
What is 0x3D(base 16) in decimal(base 10)?

0x3D = 3 x 16^1 + 13 x 16^0 = (3 x 16) + (13 x 1)
= 48 + 13 = 61

picoCTF{61}

Resources
---------
We put together a bunch of resources to help you out on our website!
If you go over there, you might even find a flag!
<Link to resource page>
scroll down -> flag

Reversing Warmup 1
------------------
Throughout your journey you will have to run many programs. Can you
navigate to <file_path> on the shell server and run tihs program
to retreive the flag?

go there -> run program -> flag

Reversing Warmup 2
------------------
Can you decode the following string dGg0dF93NHNfczFtcEwz from 
base64 format to ASCII?

echo dGg0dF93NHNfczFtcEwz | base64 -d

Crypto Warmup 1
---------------
Crypto can often be done by hand, here's a message you got from a friend
llkjmlmpadkkc with the key of thisisalilkey. Can you use this table to
solve it?

The table kinda hurts my eyes...

thisisalilkey
llkjmlmpadkkc
secretmessage

picoCTF{SECRETMESSAGE}

Crypto Warmup 2
---------------
Cyptography doesn't have to be complicated, have you ever heard of something
called rot13? cvpbPGS{guvf_vf_pelcgb!}

echo "cvpbPGS{guvf_vf_pelcgb\!}" | tr '[A-Za-z]' '[N-ZA-Mn-za-m]'

picoCTF{this_is_crypto!}

grep 1
------
Can you find the flag in file? This would be really obnoxious to look through by hand see
if you can find a faster way.

grep picoCTF file

picoCTF{grep_and_you_will_find_d66382d8}

END NIGHT 1

nat cat
-------
Using netcat (nc) will be a necessity throughout your adventure. Can you connect to 
2018shell3.picoctf.com at port 22847 to get the flag?

nc 2018shell3.picoctf.com 22847 
picoCTF{NEtcat_iS_a_NEcESSiTy_69222dcc}

Here's Johnny!
--------------
Okay, so we found some important looking files on a linux computer. Maybe they can be used to
get a password to the process. Connect with nc 2018shell3.picoctf.com 40157.

Files given were passwd and shadow

cat passwd
>root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bashroot
cat shadow

Username: root
Password: password1

strings
-------
Can you find the flag in this file without actually running it?

Given file named strings

strings strings | grep picoCTF
