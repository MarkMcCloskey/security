Phase 6 took me some time to figure out. They gave away that there needed to be
6 ints input. Then there was some verification that the input integers were <=
6. Then I had to check the contents of the nodes and recognize they were
expected to be in decreasing order. The nodes are something like this

struct node {
	int value;
	int positionInList;
	struct node *next;

} Node;

and the solution is the positionInList numbers ordered by value from greatest to least.
