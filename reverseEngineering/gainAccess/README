Access is an assignment from a reverse engineering class I'm taking. We were
given a binary that authenticates users to gain access to a turnstile and 
tasked with locating a backdoor the creators of the software made. This readme
will serve as my notes for completing this assignment.

I'll be using IDA and other standard tools during this assignment.

Start
-----
-attempted to run the binary, ran into missing library and "Error: Cannot open
password file." ...okay... tried again with args, no change.

-ran strings on the binary, nothing too exciting. Notice that the error 
message is a string within the binary.
