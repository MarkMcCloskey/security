Access is an assignment from a reverse engineering class I'm taking. We were
given a binary that authenticates users to gain access to a turnstile and 
tasked with locating a backdoor the creators of the software made. This readme
will serve as my notes for completing this assignment.

I'll be using IDA and other standard tools during this assignment.

Start
-----
-attempted to run the binary, ran into missing library and "Error: Cannot open
password file." ...okay... tried again with args, no change.

-ran strings on the binary, nothing too exciting. Notice that the error 
message is a string within the binary.

Reversing
---------

Main Function:
    Expects passwd file in /home/etc/ <-- well played. Move it there, program
                                          now runs to UN PASS prompt.
    Register a signal handler for SIGINT.
    Get terminal properties in termios struct.
    Prompt for username
    check for ctrl+c barf if found
    prompt for password
    check for ctrl+c
    Call "validate credentials"
    Free variables
    end 

Signal Handler:
    re-register same signal and handler
    increment some counter <-- probably backdoor
    

Validate Credentials:
    Open passwd file
    Get a line from it
    Read in a username:password from passwd file
        Compare file username against typed one.
            If the same encrypt typed password see if matches file one.
                If so, valid UN/password unlock turnstile.
            else check to see if password matches "%s\t\t%s" and the backdoor 
                counter == 3. If so, unlock turnstile. Backdoor'ed.
            else get another line from the file and try again.
   No more lines? access denied.

End

To backdoor this binary you need to enter a valid username from the passwd
file, I used jsun, and for the password I found I needed to enter: 
        [ctrl+c][ctrl+c][ctrl+c]%s[ctrl+v][ctrl+v]%s[enter]
and I got the access granted statement "Thank you. Turnstile unlocked please
enter the building."
