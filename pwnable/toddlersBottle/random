Prompt: Daddy, teach me how to use random value in programming!

random.c:
#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
        unsigned int random;
        random = rand();        // random value!
				// uninitialized by srand

        unsigned int key=0;
        scanf("%d", &key);

        if( (key ^ random) == 0xdeadbeef ){
                printf("Good!\n");
                system("/bin/cat flag");
                return 0;
        }

        printf("Wrong, maybe you should try 2^32 cases.\n");
        return 0;
}

Important thing here is that the random value is uninitialized and using an
unsafe source of random values. The random number will be psuedorandom
and be the same for every invocation of the program.
