Prompt: Hey! check out this C implementation of a blackjack game!
I found it online <broken link> I like to give my flags to millionares.
how much money you got?

So, the link to the C implementation doesn't work. After playing with the
game for a few minutes I realized it is very basic and pretty much a broken
mess. The dealer beat me with a hand of 26 once, the dealers hand increased by 
one until it beat mine. I think you always lose. I decided to bet a negative 
number, I lost, my score increased. Profit. Bet $-1000000. Flag.
