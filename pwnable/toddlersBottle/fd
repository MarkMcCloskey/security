The "hint" is: "Mommy! what is a file descriptor in Linux?"

//fd.c with my comments
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
char buf[32];
int main(int argc, char* argv[], char* envp[]){
        if(argc<2){
                printf("pass argv[1] a number\n");//expecting a number on command line
                return 0;
        }
        int fd = atoi( argv[1] ) - 0x1234;//subtract some arbitrary amount
        int len = 0;
        len = read(fd, buf, 32);//read from it
        if(!strcmp("LETMEWIN\n", buf)){//must be LETMEWIN
                printf("good job :)\n");
                system("/bin/cat flag");
                exit(0);
        }
        printf("learn about Linux file IO\n");//failure point
        return 0;

}

Essentially this challenge requires the user to know that file descriptors in
Linux are just integers and that the file descriptor for STDIN is 0. This
allows you to type LETMEWIN, and get the flag.
