Prompt: Mommy, I wanna play a game!

This challenge requires you to find the single fake coin in a group of coins.
The best way to guess something is in O(logn) guesses by cutting the search
space in half with every question. I notice that no matter how many coins 
they give, they always give enough guesses to find the answer.
