Level 0
-------

Simple enough to login via SSH using mobaxterm, password file is
directly in home directory.

Level 1
-------

Again password is in root directory in a file named '-'. I learned
that '-' is commonly used to refer to STDIN/STDOUT so to access the file you
can specify the full path to it. 

Level 2
-------

Again password is in root directory in a file named 'spaces in this
filename'. This was supposed to be tricky because you can't just type the
filename out. Auto-complete will correctly fill in the filename for you
otherwise you need to escape the spaces in the filename.

Level 3
-------

Password in file named .hidden in directory named inhere. Had to cd to
inhere and ls -a to see hidden files.

Level 4
-------

A bunch of possible password files in the inhere directory. cat
through them until I found one that looked like the previous passwords.
cat ./-fileXX

Level 5
-------

Password is in inhere directory with following properties
human-readable, 1033 bytes in size, not executable. In this level there are a
bunch of possibilities for the correct file so it's time to use commands to do
this for us.

I got lucky and the first command I constructed found the password. I used find
to locate a file of size 1033 bytes.

find /home/bandit5/inhere/ -type -f -size 1033c

Level 6
-------

Password is stored somewhere on the server and has the following properties:
owned by user bandit7, owned by group bandit6, 33 bytes in size.

I used the same type of find command as from level 5. What I got was a long
list of possibilities. Scanning the list I see a bunch of permission denieds
and then this nice little file ./var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password tucked in.

find . -type -f -size 33c -user bandit7 -group bandit6

Level 7
-------

Password is stored in data.txt next to the word millionth.

There is probably a better way to do this, but it is easy to use vim and 
type :/millionth to get to the line containing the password.

Could also do grep millionth data.txt to have it print to the command line.

Level 8
-------

Password is in data.txt and is the only line that occurs only once.

Sort the text file so all repeated lines are next to eachother then let uniq
find the only uniq line.
 
sort data.txt | uniq -u

Level 9
-------

Password is in data.txt in one of the few human readable strings beginning
with several '=' characters.

One way to accomplish this is to just read the binary file in vim and search
for the 'several ='.

vim data.txt
:%!xxd
/===
press n until you find something that looks like the previous passwords.

for fun: 'grep -a ========== data.txt | strings --bytes=10' looks like it was
intentional.

Level 10
--------

Password is stored in data.txt which contains base64 encoded data.

base64 -d data.txt
