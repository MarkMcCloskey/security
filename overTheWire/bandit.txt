Level 0: Simple enough to login via SSH using mobaxterm, password file is
directly in home directory.

Level 1: Again password is in root directory in a file named '-'. I learned
that '-' is commonly used to refer to STDIN/STDOUT so to access the file you
can specify the full path to it. 

Level 2: Again password is in root directory in a file named 'spaces in this
filename'. This was supposed to be tricky because you can't just type the
filename out. Auto-complete will correctly fill in the filename for you
otherwise you need to escape the spaces in the filename.

Level 3: Password in file named .hidden in directory named inhere. Had to cd to
inhere and ls -a to see hidden files.

Level 4: A bunch of possible password files in the inhere directory. cat
through them until I found one that looked like the previous passwords.
cat ./-fileXX

Level 5: Password is in inhere directory with following properties
human-readable, 1033 bytes in size, not executable. In this level there are a
bunch of possibilities for the correct file so it's time to use commands to do
this for us.
